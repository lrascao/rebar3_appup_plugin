# rebar3 relup plugins

    * There are few, rebar3_appup_plugin is one of them, it tries to automate some of the
      boring stuff that scares people away from doing more relups
    * What does it do?
      * Generates the appup
      * Validates a .appup.src file
      * Converts state records for gen_server/fsm

---

# appup generation

    * generate two releases
        * the one that is live right now
          * git checkout 1.0.0
          * rebar3 release
        * the other one that you want to upgrade to
          * git checkout 2.0.0
          * rebar3 release
    * rebar3 appup generate
        * it finds the differences in beam code for both releases and generates the appropriate
          appup instructions (for upgrade and downgrade)
    * rebar3 relup
    * rebar3 tar
    * TEST THE UPGRADE!!!
    * apply the upgrade in live

---

# automatically generated module dependencies

    * before loading a module it's dependencies should be loaded first
    * OTP takes care of that for us, all we need is to supply it with a list of dependencies
      for each module
    * xref is really good at building that list

---

# .appup.src validation and evaluation

    * when you want to customize your appup file
        * remember the Extra argument in code_change/3?
        * add more appup instructions
    * look for .appup.src files, evaluate and copy them to the output (a lot like .app.src)

---

# state record conversion

    * a lot of us use records to store gen_* processes's state
    * it's a pain, since records are tuples you can either convert them manually,
      maybe use exprecs (http://github.com/ulf/parse_trans)
    * the plugin, if properly instructed, will inject the necessary code into the target .beam
      that takes care of this for you
    * it's able to do this since it knows both record structures (the previous and the new one)
    * all it needs from you is to tell it where is the record that contains the process state

# final

    * TEST YOUR UPGRADES! (under load)
    * Have module m1 send a message to process p1, the message is an anonymous function.
    * do a load module on m1, p1 will crash
    * because brutal_purge
